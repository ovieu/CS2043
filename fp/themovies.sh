   # /p: print only the modified text.
   # -> So why do "-n /p"? Because by default, sed will print both modified and unmodified lines.
   #    However, we want only the modified expressions to be printed. "-n /p" will do exactly that.

   # i.e., interpreting newline characters correctly.

   # $(echo ... p') will return a multi-line string. The outer parenthese that encloses this $(echo...)
   # statement will parse this string with the delimiter chosen above (IFS) and create an array.
