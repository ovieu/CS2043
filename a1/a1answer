2.  pr338
3.  Mathematics and Computer Science 2017
4.  No experience with Unix
5.  Unix is used a lot. I feel like it is important to be familiar with it.
6.  I think the class is going well. A little hard to find a seat if a little late from last class. Hard to see/hear from back. However, I will try to come early and find a seat in the front from now on. Looking forward to learning more about Unix tools and scripting.
7.  Assignment was hard to get started and easy after. First time using terminal. Used trial and error; however, at times it was hard to know whether what I was doing was right or wrong with the read, write, and execute thing. I wish I understood the output to know if I did it right. Assignment was interesting!
